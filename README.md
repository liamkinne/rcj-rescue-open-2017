# Open Rescue Robot for RCJ 2017

Also known as VECTOR, my Open Rescue robot has a unique design and lightning speed.

## Design
Using a static-motor rotating wrist grabber, my robot rotates the victim capsule instead of lifting it making it faster than almost any other design.
The line-follow algorythm utilised is also much faster and more accurate giving VECTOR a huge time advantage over competitors.
